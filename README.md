# Price-Prediction-Model

The Assure US Summer Research was an internship held to teach students proper evaluation of large data pools, using a TensorFlow Keras, Jupyter Notebook, predictive models, and application to real-life scenarios and data.
As an intern, my progress and completion were evaluated by my ability to produce a predictive model based on a dataset of my choosing under the supervision of Dr Doina Bein.
In my project, I made a predictive model for second-hand vehicles with an accuracy of 64% based on a number of statistics taken on second-hand vehicles collected over a specified amount of time. We did this by filtering out all the important data necessary to be input and fed it into the model. All of this was done with Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
